Exercises for Python Programming 101.

Exercise 1.
        The program that you create for this exercise will begin by reading the cost of a meal ordered at a restaurant from the user. Then your program will compute the tax and tip for the meal. Use your local tax rate when computing the amount of tax owing. Compute the tip as 18 percent of the meal amount (without the tax). The output from your program should include the tax amount, the tip amount, and the grand total for the meal including both the tax and the tip. 

        use:  int(input())

Exercise 2.
        Write a function that takes a list of numbers and iterates through each number on a list and counts all numbers that are equal to 1.

        a_list = [1,3,55,1,9,4,56,2,1,8]


Exercise 3.
        a) Write a Python function to sum all the numbers in a list.
        b) Write a Python function to multiply all the numbers in a list.
        a_list = [8, 2, 3, -1, 7]

Exercise 4.
        Write a Python program to print the even numbers from a given list.
        use: check python built-in help() to learn how to use append(). 

Exercise 5.
        Write a Python program to get the smallest number from a list.
        hint: To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index. a_list[0] 

Exercise 6.
        Write a Python program to reverse a string. 
        Sample String : "1234abcd"
        Expected Output : "dcba4321"

Exercise 7.
        Write a Python program that prints all the numbers from 0 to 9 except 3 and 6.
        use: Continue. It returns the control to the beginning of the while loop.. The continue statement rejects all the remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop and moves the control back to the top of the loop.

Exercise 8.
        Write a Python program that accepts a string and calculate the number of digits and letters.
        use: help() to learn how to use isalpha() and isdigit()
